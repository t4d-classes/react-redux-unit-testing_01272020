## Steps

1. Create a component named Tool Footer. The component should produce the following output:

```html
<footer>
  <small>&copy; 2020 A Cool Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</small>
</footer>
```

The year is the year when the component is rendered. Please configure the company name to be a prop.

2. Create a snapshot test. Inspect the output of the snapshot test.

3. Did you create your component in a deterministic way?
